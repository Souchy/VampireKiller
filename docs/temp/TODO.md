# TODO

1. Maybe use Synty assets since they're all ready
    - Plus you get to extract the characters from the unity bullshit
    - The decors are pretty nice
2. 2D could be appreciable, more simple, in the same genre as Terraria / Risk of Rain and other roguelikes
3. Coop multiplayer over network or local
    - Playable without internet
4. Choose rewards after each round
5. Random events
    - Merchant can appear after a round
    - Epic boss with better drops can appear randomly
6. Rarity
    - Common, Rare, Legendary, Mythic, Epic, Relic
    - Destroy/recycle shit items to get money
7. Dont need a database and full editors
    - Maybe some json files
    - Spells can be hardcoded
8. Sell 5$
    - Steam API
    - Steam leaderboards
    - Itch.io
    - Twitter
    - Dofus discord + encyclofus
9. Controls
    - Keys for spells + Wasd movement + mouse aim
    - Keys for spells + Mouse movement + mouse aim
    - Controller (can test with ps2)
10. Horny sells
11. Ridiculous is funny (disgaea)
