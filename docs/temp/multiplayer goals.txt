Database should be in [hardcode or files] to be able to run [locally without internet]


Game should include both the client and the server
People can host games on their pc to play with others (COOP)

We may have a central server (WebAPI?) to list public lobbies and friends lobbies
	and connect people to the right IP without them having to input it
	put the server port in the settings
	(must include a guide/instructions on how to open a port in UDP)


So Server and Client code should live in the same project/application. (in layer 2 app, before presentation?)


Node.multiplayer = MultiplayerAPI 
MultiplayerAPI: singleton?

Server class: setup a multiplayer object
Client class: setup a multiplayer object


///We have a strong dependancy on Godot for our server communication
///So we may as well use Godot Resources for our data
Just use Godot as a UDP library (ENet implementation), but nothing else on the layer 2
Keep the events+commands separation from scenes

Rpc(..) = broadcast
RpcId(x, ..) = send to 1 peer
